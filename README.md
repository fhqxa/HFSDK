# HFSDK
Paper title:Robust hierarchical feature selection driven by data and knowledge
The proposed method: HFSDK

HFSDK is realized by matlab code.
Algorithm function: fun_Hier_CapLpSVM_W21_Wch.m
main function of feature selection and test processes: fun_Hier_CapLpSVM_W21_Wch.m


HFSDK is compared with several hierarchical feature selection methods, such as: HFSNM, HRelief, HmRMR, HFisher, HFSPS, and HCSVM.

All methods are realized by Matlab 2016a on a PC with 16G memory and i7-3770 CPU.
